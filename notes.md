__Four Principles:__
- Invitation to dinner: intent to creat legal relation ?
- Silver watch case(promise made when drunk among friends): Are both sides serious ?
  - Leonard vs Pepsi: Are both sides serious ?
- legal and moral ?
- gift or bargain ?

- Bargain: an agreement betweeen parties  as to what one party will do for another.
- Bargains aer:
  - commercial
  - productive interchanges

- governemnts do note enforce promises that are:
  - - jokes
  - part of relations between friends(frolic and banter/no intention of forming legal relationship)
  - promises to make gifts

- One sided promies: Both paties must exchange value otherwise it is a one sided bargain.
- Government does not back or stand behind one sided bargains.
- Lack of mutualisty: Mutuality of obligation :
- Both parties must be bound to perform their obligations or the law will treat th agreement as if neither party is bound tor intended to perform.
  - When the offerror and the offeree exchanges  promises to perform, one party may not be given the absolute and unlimited right to cancel the contract.

- Good Faith: The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is a generat presumption that the parties to a contract will deal with each other honestly, fairly and in good faith, so as to not destroy the right of the other party or paries to receive benefits of the contracts
- "In every contract, theres is an implied covenant that neither party shall do anything, which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruites of the contract"
- "Every contract has an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing."

- basiss of contract is mutual promiseses


---

  - Promissor: The person that makes the promises
  - offereor: the person who initiates the exchanges
    - The offeror sets the terms of the exchange
  - offereee: the receiving party oto the exchange of the promise made by the offeror. He can accept or propose a promise of their own.

- The contract is formed when the offer is accepted. THe exchange is bilateral.
- Promise for promise: I promise to do ... if you promise to ...
- Promise for performance: I promise to ... if ... happens (deliverables are met)

---
- Morrir image ruleL An unequivocal and absolute acceptance requirement(conditional promise) states that an offer must be accepted exactly with no modifications i.e a mirror image oof the proposal.
- An attempt to acceptt the offer on different terms is termed as a counter offer.

- "A person should not be bound to a primise e's never made"
- Not just freedom of contract but freedom from contract.

---
- Option: the right to require another person to uphold the agreed - upon terms
- an option is a part of the contract but has to be exercised for the contractto come into play.


- Promises made with enough deliberation and formality will be enforced by the government. Even if there is no actual bargain. (in cases of charitable donations)

- Detrimental Reliance: {need to check}

- THe reliance on promise must be:
  - Reasonable
  - Forseeable

- Civil law originates from germany and france. Common law is of british descent
- Napolean came up with Private law (civil). known for comprehensiveness, system and simplicity of statement.
- "An ordinary citizen must be able to interpret it without an army of specialists." Called it "code Napolean" and is now known as "code civil"
